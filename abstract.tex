This extends the delayed Kalman filter to a delayed extended Kalman filter that takes into account the delays of the measurement. The filter uses GPS and camera measurements for the estimation of the states of an unmanned aerial system (UAS). The GPS output is delayed by a random number, which produces the out-of-sequence measurement problem. The filter is based on calculating the states with the measurements at the moment, so that when the delayed measurements are available, the optimal filter for the time of the measurement is calculated and propagated to the present time. The estimates provided by the filter are used to point an antenna and a camera towards the UAS.
