  Abstract                 = { In target tracking systems measurements are typically collected in "scans" or "frames" and then they are transmitted to a processing center. In multisensor tracking systems that operate in a centralized manner, there are usually different time delays in transmitting the scans or frames from the various sensors to the center. This can lead to situations where measurements from the same target arrive out of sequence. Such "out-of-sequence" measurement (OOSM) arrivals can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays. The resulting "negative-time measurement update" problem, which is quite common in real multisensor systems, was solved previously only approximately in the literature. The exact state update equation for such a problem is presented. The optimal and two suboptimal algorithms are compared on a number of realistic examples, including a GMTI (ground moving target indicator) radar case.},

  Abstract                 = { In multisensor target tracking systems measurements from the same target can arrive out of sequence. Such "out-of-sequence" measurement (OOSM) arrivals can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays. The resulting problem - how to update the current state estimate with an "older" measurement - is a nonstandard estimation problem. It was solved first (suboptimally, then optimally) for the case where the OOSM lies between the two last measurements, i.e, its lag is less than a sampling interval - the 1-step-lag case. The real world has, however, OOSMs with arbitrary lag. Subsequently, the suboptimal algorithm was extended to the case of an arbitrary (multistep) lag, but the resulting algorithm required a significant amount of storage. The present work shows how the 1-step-lag algorithms can be generalized to handle an arbitrary (multistep) lag while preserving their main feature of solving the update problem without iterating. This leads only to a very small (a few percent) degradation of MSE performance. The incorporation of an OOSM into the data association process is also discussed. A realistic example with two GMTI radars is presented. The consistency of the proposed algorithm is also evaluated and it is found that its calculated covariances are reliable.},

  Abstract                 = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in military and scientific research. Some miniaturized UAVs rely entirely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation. GPS is vulnerable to accidental or deliberate interference that can cause it to fail. It is not unusual, even in a benign environment, for a GPS outage to occur for periods of seconds to minutes. For UAVs relying solely on GPS for navigation such an event can be catastrophic. This paper proposes an extended Kalman filter approach to estimate the location of a UAV when its GPS connection is lost, using inter-UAV distance measurements. The results from a recent trial conducted by DSTO in Australia with three UAVs are presented. It is shown that the location of a manoeuvering UAV that has lost the GPS signal can be determined to an accuracy of within 40m of its true location simply by measuring the range to two other UAVs at known location, where the range measurement error has a zero mean and a standard deviation of 10m.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an exact solution to the delayed data problem for the information form of the Kalman filter, together with its application to decentralised sensing networks. To date, the most common method of handling delayed data in sensing networks has been to use a conservative time alignment of the observation data with the filter time. However, by accounting for the correlation between the late data and the filter over the delayed period, an exact solution is possible. The inclusion of this information correlation term adds little extra complexity, and may be applied in an information filter update stage which is associative. The delayed data algorithm can also be used to handle data that is asequent or out of order. The asequent data problem is presented in a simple recursive information filter form. The information filter equations presented in this paper are applied in a decentralised picture compilation problem. This involves multiple aircraft tracking multiple ground targets and the construction of a single common tactical picture.},

  Abstract                 = { An extension is presented to the particle filtering toolbox that enables nonlinear/non-Gaussian filtering to be performed in the presence of out-of-sequence measurements (OOSMs) with arbitrary lag, without the need to adopt linearising approximations in the filter and without the degradation of performance that would occur if the OOSMs were simply discarded. An estimate of the performance of the OOSM particle filter (OOSM-PF) is obtained for bearings-only tracking scenarios with a single target and a small number of sensors. These performance estimates are then compared with the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the state estimate rms error and similar performance estimates obtained from the oosm extended Kalman filter (OOSM-EKF) algorithms recently introduced in the literature. For a mildly nonlinear bearings-only tracking problem the OOSM-PF and OOSM-EKF are shown to achieve broadly similar performance.},

The current focus of the research includes (1) optimizing the UAV trajectories to place them at desired locations at desired times to capture target locations, (2) cooperative sensor scheduling, and (3) intelligent fusing of multiple sensor measurements to accurately estimate the position and velocity of a target. The focus of this paper is the sensor-fusion task. One might consider addressing this problem using some formof Kalman filter. However, a complicating factor in the present application is that sensor readings arrive out-of-sequence to the sensor- fusion process. For example, there is non-deterministic latency in the inter- and intra-UAV communication channels. We address this problem by developing an out-of-order sigma-point Kalman filter (O3SPKF).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the modeling, analysis and controlled simulation (motion control) of a two degree of freedom pan tilt platform (PTP) for positioning or aiming a device. The PTP has two revolute joints. The PTP, with two degrees of freedom, is a device that makes it possible for the camera to point in a desired direction when mounted under a carrier such as an aircraft. The objective of this research work is to derive a linear and nonlinear control system of the PTP to point in a desired direction within allowable specifications. This paper covers the feedback control system with PD controllers for position control of pan and tilt mechanism. These PD controllers derived from linear system model are also used in nonlinear control system simulation. The nonlinear control system developed in this paper is nearest to the physical system. To perform the analysis and simulation, all the parameters involved in the system dynamics were identified. The practicality of this research work can be extended to a broad range of applications. The most apparent use is in security, where there is a strong emphasis on reliably neutralizing threats without risking human life. The unmanned aerial systems (i.e. the PTP on unmanned aerial vehicle) can provide significant reductions in manpower and risk to humans for critical security roles. The role of PTP has been increased significantly in the last few years in the security and defense applications.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

  Abstract                 = {In multisensor target tracking systems receiving out-of-sequence measurements (OOSMs) from local sensors is a common situation. In the last decade many algorithms have been proposed to update with an OOSM optimally or suboptimally. However, what one faces in the real world is the multiple OOSMs, which arrive at the fusion center in, generally, arbitrary orders, e.g., in succession or interleaved with in-sequence measurements. A straightforward approach to deal with this multi-OOSM problem is by sequentially applying a given OOSM algorithm; however, this simple solution does not guarantee the optimal update under the multi-OOSM scenario. The work presented here discusses the differences between the single-OOSM processing and the multi-OOSM processing, and presents the general solution to the multi-OOSM problem, which is called the complete in-sequence information (CISI) approach. Given an OOSM, in addition to updating the state at the most recent time, the CISI approach also updates the states between the OOSM time and the most recent time, including the state at the OOSM time. Three novel CISI methods are developed in this paper: the information filter-equivalent measurement (IF-EqM) method, the CISI fixed-point smoothing (CISI-FPS) method and the CISI fixed-interval smoothing (CISI-FIS) method. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the optimality of these CISI methods under various multi-OOSM scenarios.},
