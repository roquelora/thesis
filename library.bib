abstract = { In target tracking systems measurements are typically collected in "scans" or "frames" and then they are transmitted to a processing center. In multisensor tracking systems that operate in a centralized manner, there are usually different time delays in transmitting the scans or frames from the various sensors to the center. This can lead to situations where measurements from the same target arrive out of sequence. Such "out-of-sequence" measurement (OOSM) arrivals can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays. The resulting "negative-time measurement update" problem, which is quite common in real multisensor systems, was solved previously only approximately in the literature. The exact state update equation for such a problem is presented. The optimal and two suboptimal algorithms are compared on a number of realistic examples, including a GMTI (ground moving target indicator) radar case.},

abstract = { In multisensor target tracking systems measurements from the same target can arrive out of sequence. Such "out-of-sequence" measurement (OOSM) arrivals can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays. The resulting problem - how to update the current state estimate with an "older" measurement - is a nonstandard estimation problem. It was solved first (suboptimally, then optimally) for the case where the OOSM lies between the two last measurements, i.e, its lag is less than a sampling interval - the 1-step-lag case. The real world has, however, OOSMs with arbitrary lag. Subsequently, the suboptimal algorithm was extended to the case of an arbitrary (multistep) lag, but the resulting algorithm required a significant amount of storage. The present work shows how the 1-step-lag algorithms can be generalized to handle an arbitrary (multistep) lag while preserving their main feature of solving the update problem without iterating. This leads only to a very small (a few percent) degradation of MSE performance. The incorporation of an OOSM into the data association process is also discussed. A realistic example with two GMTI radars is presented. The consistency of the proposed algorithm is also evaluated and it is found that its calculated covariances are reliable.},

First, we build on an existing minimum variance estimation algorithm for out-of-sequence processing of sensor measurements, extending the algorithm to handle multiple lags and multiple dynamic models. We study the performance of the algorithms with numerical examples. Second, we establish a connection between the maximum entropy of a partially known multivariable Gaussian distribution and a particular Bayesian network, whose structure is based on the available information. The connection leads to a useful methodology for identifying missing information in systems described by Bayesian networks, a key tool in developing algorithms for information flow in decentralized systems},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in military and scientific research. Some miniaturized UAVs rely entirely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation. GPS is vulnerable to accidental or deliberate interference that can cause it to fail. It is not unusual, even in a benign environment, for a GPS outage to occur for periods of seconds to minutes. For UAVs relying solely on GPS for navigation such an event can be catastrophic. This paper proposes an extended Kalman filter approach to estimate the location of a UAV when its GPS connection is lost, using inter-UAV distance measurements. The results from a recent trial conducted by DSTO in Australia with three UAVs are presented. It is shown that the location of a manoeuvering UAV that has lost the GPS signal can be determined to an accuracy of within 40m of its true location simply by measuring the range to two other UAVs at known location, where the range measurement error has a zero mean and a standard deviation of 10m.},

To date, the most common method of handling delayed data in sensing networks has been to use a conservative time alignment of the observation data with the filter time. However, by accounting for the correlation between the late data and the filter over the delayed period, an exact solution is possible. The inclusion of this information correlation term adds little extra complexity, and may be applied in an information filter update stage which is associative. The delayed data algorithm can also be used to handle data that is asequent or out of order. The asequent data problem is presented in a simple recursive information filter form. The information filter equations presented in this paper are applied in a decentralised picture compilation problem. This involves multiple aircraft tracking multiple ground targets and the construction of a single common tactical picture.},

An estimate of the performance of the OOSM particle filter (OOSM-PF) is obtained for bearings-only tracking scenarios with a single target and a small number of sensors. These performance estimates are then compared with the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the state estimate rms error and similar performance estimates obtained from the oosm extended Kalman filter (OOSM-EKF) algorithms recently introduced in the literature.

The focus of this paper is the sensor-fusion task. One might consider addressing this problem using some formof Kalman filter. However, a complicating factor in the present application is that sensor readings arrive out-of-sequence to the sensor- fusion process.

The objective of this research work is to derive a linear and nonlinear control system of the PTP to point in a desired direction within allowable specifications. This paper covers the feedback control system with PD controllers for position control of pan and tilt mechanism. These PD controllers derived from linear system model are also used in nonlinear control system simulation. The nonlinear control system developed in this paper is nearest to the physical system. To perform the analysis and simulation, all the parameters involved in the system dynamics were identified. The practicality of this research work can be extended to a broad range of applications. The most apparent use is in security, where there is a strong emphasis on reliably neutralizing threats without risking human life. The unmanned aerial systems (i.e. the PTP on unmanned aerial vehicle) can provide significant reductions in manpower and risk to humans for critical security roles.

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

abstract = {In multisensor target tracking systems receiving out-of-sequence measurements (OOSMs) from local sensors is a common situation. In the last decade many algorithms have been proposed to update with an OOSM optimally or suboptimally. However, what one faces in the real world is the multiple OOSMs, which arrive at the fusion center in, generally, arbitrary orders, e.g., in succession or interleaved with in-sequence measurements. A straightforward approach to deal with this multi-OOSM problem is by sequentially applying a given OOSM algorithm; however, this simple solution does not guarantee the optimal update under the multi-OOSM scenario. The work presented here discusses the differences between the single-OOSM processing and the multi-OOSM processing, and presents the general solution to the multi-OOSM problem, which is called the complete in-sequence information (CISI) approach. Given an OOSM, in addition to updating the state at the most recent time, the CISI approach also updates the states between the OOSM time and the most recent time, including the state at the OOSM time. Three novel CISI methods are developed in this paper: the information filter-equivalent measurement (IF-EqM) method, the CISI fixed-point smoothing (CISI-FPS) method and the CISI fixed-interval smoothing (CISI-FIS) method. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the optimality of these CISI methods under various multi-OOSM scenarios.},
