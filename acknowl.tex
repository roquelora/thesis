\begin{acknowledgments} 

I want to acknowledge God, as the one that gave me the opportunity and strength to reach this milestone in my life. My wife, who was the biggest pillar in my life during the whole master. She always supported me giving me strength during the successes and failures and was the one that comforted me when I felt frustrated. She is the main source of my inspiration. Dr. Sharma, who made this whole research possible. Dr. Sharma took me as his student since he arrived at USU, even when I did not have a clear subject for my research. He dedicated countless hours of his time to polish and guide me through this whole research. I am very grateful for his support, patience and the knowledge that he shared with me. To my family, who gave me support and believed in me since day one. To AggieAir, who taught me so much and helped me developed as a professional. And to all the friends that made this whole experience unforgettable.
