The goal of this thesis is to develop an algorithm to point an antenna and a camera towards a UAV. The techniques presented in \cite{Larsen1998} and in \cite{Beard2010a} are going to be combined to produce the algorithm called the Delayed Extended Kalman filter. This filter is expected to estimates the states of the system more precisely than any of the two techniques by their own. Different scenarios are simulated for the purpose of comparing the efficiency of this technique in various situations.
